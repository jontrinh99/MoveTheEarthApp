# Meet The Earth 
## Purpose:

   A centralized nutritional application geared towards powerlifting to help log nutrition, diet, and workout routine. Help users track personal progress and improve on the three main lifts: Bench Press, Deadlift, Squat. We want to include the user's workouts and progress in their routine through various means, such as logging the sets, repetitions, and weight lifted through every workout. The user would input their progress into a daily log, and the application would track the user's daily progress, offering various charts and data to help show progression and trends throughout a period of time.
  
 Due to the ongoing pandemic, we decided to pivot towards the creation of this application in order to reconnect with our active lifestyles in the gym. Born as a hobby between three colleagues, being able to powerlift and pursue an active lifestyle at the gym became a sacrifice that had to be made in order to stay safe amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, due to our technical background, we were all able to come together and rekindle our love for powerlifting through the development of this application. We were not only able to enhance our technical skills and expertise, but also were all able to come together to work as a team, helping to enhance various soft skills that are often overlooked. Through collaboration, all members worked together to enhance our communication skills, teamwork, time management, and refocus our drive towards becoming successful as we enter post-grad and focus on becoming successful in our respective professional careers.
